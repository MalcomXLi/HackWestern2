# AnswerMeThis

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This project was inspired from an article we read about an article which talked about the impact mobile devices were making in third world countries, such as Africa. Mobile development in these countries are increasing by the second and we wanted to take part in that development.This app allows users to get answers to a large variety of questions at almost any time. This is achieved through the use of the Twilio and Wolfram API. A user can text the application a question such as; integrate x^2, 2+4, plot(logx), what time is it, etc. Users can also ask for some dictionary definitions such as economics, ball, and H2O for example. This is all done by making a request to Wolfram and parsing the data into a readable sms or mms message.
